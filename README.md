# JavaDesignPatterns

1. Factory Design Pattern : com.learn.design.patterns.factorydesignpattern<br/>
We do not want to expose the creational logic to the client and we create object using a standard interface.<br>
It is also known as a Virtual Constructor<br>

Steps:
Create a main class which calls the factory class
Factory class returns the required class instance


Main Class -> Factory Class -> Profession (“Engineer”, “Doctor”, “Teacher”)
